# results/ — measured artefacts

Every number in [`../docs/EVALUATION.md`](../docs/EVALUATION.md) is read from
one of these files. All block-2 results use the frozen, pre-registered
configuration (OOD threshold 576.11).

**Placeholders.** Absolute paths of the machines that produced these records
were replaced by placeholders — `<REPO>` (this repository), `<DATA_ROOT>`,
`<ALL_IDB>`, `<PROTOTYPE_FIELDS>`, `<PROTOTYPE_DATASET>`, `<BLOCK2_HANDOFF>`
(the block-2 device kit folder), `<TRAINING_WORKDIR>`, `<FIELDS>` (the input
folder of a session), `<OUTPUT>`, `<WORKDIR>`, `<HOME>`. Nothing else in the
records was changed; the `fields_sha256` and `sha256` values of the manifests hash
file contents and are unaffected.
In `crop_manifest.csv` files, `source_image` is `<FIELDS>/<file name>` and
`crop_path` is `crops/<file name>`. The CPU re-run directories carry English
names, also used in `cpu_reruns_frozen/cpu_reruns_summary.csv` and as the `session_id`
of their `result.json`.

## Naming of the prototype batches

Files and directories use the historical tag `x40` for the fields acquired with
the add-on through the ×40 dry objective (*prototype fields* in the article).

| Directory | Article name |
|---|---|
| `block2_v2_benchmarks/x40_stress_test/`, `cpu_reruns_frozen/prototype_test_batch/` | prototype test batch (test split, 104 fields, 183 WBCs) |
| `block2_v2_benchmarks/x40_stress_train_part_aa/`, `cpu_reruns_frozen/prototype_batch_A/` | prototype batch A (training split, 102 fields) |
| `block2_v2_benchmarks/x40_stress_train_part_ab/`, `cpu_reruns_frozen/prototype_batch_B/` | prototype batch B (training split, 101 readable fields) |
| `block2_v2_benchmarks/x40_stress_val/`, `cpu_reruns_frozen/prototype_validation_batch/` | prototype validation batch (validation split, 43 fields) |
| `x40_testsplit/`, `x40_threshold/`, `leukocyte_yield/` | prototype test / validation fields (localizer) |

Each `*manifest*.json` records the command, the clock state, the image list
and the package versions of its run.
