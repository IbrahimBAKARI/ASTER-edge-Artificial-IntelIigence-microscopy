## What the prototype does

```
microscopy fields (4032 × 3040, ×40 dry objective)        one acquisition session
  └─ block 1  YOLO11n single-class WBC localizer, adapted to the add-on's own fields
              imgsz 960, conf 0.18, NMS IoU 0.50, crop padding +10 % per side
  └─ block 2  one ResNet18 encoder pass per crop → 16-class cell head
              → prevalence-corrected proportions (Adjusted Classify-and-Count)
              → gated-attention MIL screening score P_abn
              → Mahalanobis out-of-domain gate (threshold 576.11)
              → frozen decision grid: three-way Jeffreys test, γ = 0.90,
                tiers of 100 / 200 / 400 classified leukocytes
  └─ result.json (status, label, tier, flags, reasons, evidence) + overlays + crops + manifest
```

Hardware: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB (Super), USB C-mount camera (Arducam IMX477
HQ), interchangeable ocular / C-mount adapters, 7-inch touch display, NVMe SSD.
The host microscope is not modified.

**Configuration.** This release contains the frozen, pre-registered block 2
(grid frozen 2026-09-10; amendments 1–8 before the test; amendment 9 post hoc,
not adopted). Every result in `results/` and `docs/EVALUATION.md` was obtained
with exactly the models in `models/`.

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `run.py`, `config/`, `aster_pipeline/`, `backend/`, `YOLO/`, `Interface/`, `tests/` | the deployed pipeline: entry point, single parameter file (`config/inference.yaml`), blocks 1 and 2, service layer, PyQt5 touch interface (native-resolution capture, [`Interface/CAMERA.md`](Interface/CAMERA.md)), tests |
| `models/` | localizer weights, block-2 encoder / heads / grid / thresholds / OOD statistics, checksums — [`models/MODELS.md`](models/MODELS.md) |
| `localizer_adaptation/` | how the localizer was adapted to the prototype fields (Colab notebook, split builder, evaluator) |
| `evaluation/` | leukocyte yield of the deployed localizer |
| `experiments/` | post hoc resolution control, progressive OOD perturbations, and frozen inter-slide evaluation, with notebooks, protocols and result files |
| `scripts/` | on-device benchmarks (latency, energy), TensorRT engine builders, operating-point selection, campaign procedures |
| `block2_development/` | block 2: pre-registration and amendments, training code and notebook, record of the training run, technical report, Jetson verification kit — [`block2_development/README.md`](block2_development/README.md) |

## Quick start (PyTorch path, CPU or CUDA)

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt      # outside a Jetson: remove the two index lines first (REPRODUCE.md § 0)
cd models && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt && cd ..
.venv/bin/python run.py --input <folder of session fields> --session-id demo \
    --output results_sessions/demo --device cpu
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
.venv/bin/python experiments/verify_release_results.py
```

Statuses: `completed` (a label, possibly `indeterminate`), `insufficient_evidence`
(< 100 classified leukocytes), `out_of_domain` (outside the validated acquisition
domain), `no_decision` (no WBC detected). The TensorRT FP16 path needs engines
built on the device: `scripts/export_yolo_trt.sh`, `scripts/build_block2_trt.sh`.

| Frozen localizer on two entirely unseen slides (159 fields, 241 WBC) | pooled mAP@50 **0.904**; precision 0.934 and recall 0.768 at conf 0.18 |

| Board power: idle / camera / analysis loop | 5.23 / 5.68 / 7.70 W |

## Data availability

- **Public datasets** (LeukemiaAttri, AML-Cytomorphology_MLL_Helmholtz,
  AML-Cytomorphology_LMU, PBC, MILLIE, ALL-IDB, cAItomorph) are distributed by
  their authors under their own terms and are **not** redistributed here; their
  identifiers are in [`docs/DATA.md`](docs/DATA.md) and the construction of every
  split in [`data_splits/`](data_splits/).
- **Prototype fields acquired with the add-on** (478 fields and their WBC
  annotations; non-leukemic educational smears, no patient data): **available
  from the authors on reasonable request.** Their split, triage verdicts, capture
  times and every result computed on them are included.
