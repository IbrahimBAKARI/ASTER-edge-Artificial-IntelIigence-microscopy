# EVALUATION.md — measured performance of the prototype

Every number below is read from a file in `results/` (or in
`block2_development/training_run_20260911_051357Z/`), named next to it.
Configuration: the **frozen, pre-registered block 2** (decision grid frozen
2026-09-10, thresholds resolved 2026-09-11, amendments 1–8 adopted before the
test, amendment 9 analysed post hoc and not adopted). Out-of-domain threshold
**576.11**. Measurement environment: [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md)
(NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano 8 GB Super, JetPack 6.2, L4T R36.4.7, `nvpmodel`
MAXN_SUPER).

**Naming.** The fields acquired with the add-on through the ×40 dry objective
are called *prototype fields* in the article. In file and directory names they
carry the historical tag `x40` (for example `results/x40_testsplit/`,
`evaluation/x40_yield.py`); see [`../results/README.md`](../results/README.md)
for the mapping of every batch.

## 1. WBC localizer (block 1)

YOLO11n, single class, recipe `exp4_domain_aug` with `nonone` labels (real WBC
boxes only), fine-tuned to the prototype fields by mixed replay
(`localizer_adaptation/`). Deployed at **imgsz 960, conf 0.18, NMS IoU 0.50,
crop padding 10 %**.

### 1.1 Domain transfer before adaptation — `results/domain_transfer_12runs.json`, `results/localizer_transfer_478/x40_eval.csv`

Twelve recipes (four training-data regimes × three treatments of the `None`
boxes), trained on the public LeukemiaAttri data only:

| | Range over the 12 recipes |
|---|---|
| mAP@50, each recipe's public test split | 0.914 – 0.939 |
| mAP@50, the 478 prototype fields | 0.023 – 0.386 |
| Recall, the 478 prototype fields | ≤ 0.348 |

Spearman correlation between public-test and prototype mAP@50: ρ = 0.51
(p = 0.09). Per-recipe values: `results/derived/domain_transfer_12runs_with_x40_478.csv`.

### 1.2 Adaptation, within-slide evaluation split (104 fields, 171 boxes) — `results/x40_testsplit/`, `results/x40_threshold/selection.json`

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Four candidate recipes before adaptation, mAP@50 | 0.306 – 0.396 (exp4/nonone: 0.371) |
| Deployed model after mixed replay, mAP@50 (conf 0.001) — `x40_testsplit/deployed_after_adaptation.json` | **0.982** |
| At the operating point (conf 0.1812, NMS 0.50), Ultralytics validator: P / R / mAP@50 / mAP@50-95 | 0.9211 / 0.9556 / 0.9565 / 0.6436 |
| Source-domain check, LeukemiaAttri test mAP@50 before → after | 0.934 → 0.925 (after: notebook run on Colab, see note) |

The two recipes that ranked first on the prototype fields (exp2/nonone and
exp4/nonone) were both adapted; exp4/nonone was retained
(`localizer_adaptation/README.md`). The "before" LeukemiaAttri value is in
`domain_transfer_12runs.json`; the "after" LeukemiaAttri value was printed by the Colab
adaptation notebook, whose run state is not part of this release.

The 104 fields were excluded from gradient updates and threshold selection, but
the recipe ranking used all 478 prototype fields and the two adapted candidates
were compared on this split. It is therefore a within-slide evaluation split
held out from fine-tuning, not a fully independent model-selection test.

### 1.2a Post hoc resolution control — `experiments/resolution_ablation/`

All checkpoints were evaluated with the same evaluator on the same 104 fields.
The source detector scored 0.3722 at 640 pixels and 0.5015 at 960 pixels. A new
mixed-replay checkpoint adapted and evaluated at 640 pixels scored 0.9679. The
deployed 960-pixel checkpoint scored 0.9823 when evaluated at 960 pixels. Thus,
evaluation resolution alone explains 0.1293 mAP@50, while adaptation at fixed
640-pixel evaluation explains 0.5957. The 640- and 960-pixel adaptation runs
were not identical repeats, so their difference does not isolate training
resolution alone.

### 1.2b Frozen inter-slide evaluation — `experiments/inter_slide_generalization/`

The deployed localizer was frozen and evaluated without retraining or threshold
adjustment on two additional educational smears acquired with the same ASTER
setup. The pooled 159 fields contained 241 annotated WBCs. Pooled mAP@50 was
0.9038 and mAP@50-95 was 0.6057. At the fixed deployment operating point
(confidence 0.18, NMS IoU 0.50), precision was 0.9343 and recall was 0.7676
(185 TP, 13 FP and 56 FN). Per-slide values are reported in the experiment
directory. This is preliminary inter-slide evidence, not multi-site validation.

### 1.3 Operating point — `results/x40_threshold/selection.json`, `curves.csv`

Maximum mean F1 on the 43-field prototype **validation** split (never the test
split), imgsz 960, NMS IoU ∈ {0.50, 0.60, 0.70}: **conf 0.18 / NMS IoU 0.50**
(best conf 0.1812; validation F1 0.9565, P 0.9296, R 0.985).

### 1.4 Leukocyte yield at native resolution — `results/leukocyte_yield/` (`evaluation/x40_yield.py`)

104 within-slide evaluation fields; ground truth 171 boxes, 1.64 WBC per field. Greedy
matching at IoU ≥ 0.5.

| conf | Detections | TP | FP | P | R | F1 | WBC/field (mean · sd) | Fields for 50 WBC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.05 | 196 | 169 | 27 | 0.8622 | 0.9883 | 0.9210 | 1.885 · 1.211 | 26.5 |
| 0.15 | 185 | 166 | 19 | 0.8973 | 0.9708 | 0.9326 | 1.779 · 1.065 | 28.1 |
| **0.18** | **183** | **164** | **19** | **0.8962** | **0.9591** | **0.9266** | **1.760 · 1.079** | **28.4** |
| 0.25 | 180 | 164 | 16 | 0.9111 | 0.9591 | 0.9345 | 1.731 · 1.031 | 28.9 |
| 0.50 | 167 | 158 | 9 | 0.9461 | 0.9240 | 0.9349 | 1.606 · 0.882 | 31.1 |

At the mean yield of 1.76 WBC per field, the session tiers of block 2 need
about 57 fields (100 classified leukocytes), 114 fields (200) and 227 fields
(400) — `results/derived/session_cost_by_tier.json`.

Recall by triage verdict, before → after adaptation
(`results/derived/detections_x40test_by_triage.csv`): keep 0.394 → 0.958,
review 0.408 → 0.939, reject 0.490 → 0.980.

### 1.5 PyTorch ↔ TensorRT parity — `results/embedded_campaign/*/yolo_isolated*.json`

- Box parity, **deployed weights**, operating point, 9 ALL-IDB L2 fields:
  95 PyTorch boxes, 94 FP16 boxes, **93 matched, mean IoU 0.881**.

### 1.6 Isolated localizer latency — `results/embedded_campaign/`

| Median ms per field (imgsz 960) | DVFS | Pinned clocks |
|---|---|---|
| PyTorch `.pt` | 64.3 | 64.3 |
| TensorRT FP16 `.engine` | 48.7 | 48.5 |
| Speed-up | ×1.32 | ×1.33 |

The DVFS file `yolo_isolated_100runs.json` was transcribed from the console
output (its `_note` field says why); the pinned-clock file is the raw output.

## 2. Session decision (block 2)

### 2.1 Primary test — cAItomorph, 409 patients, pre-registered

Reference run: `block2_development/training_run_20260911_051357Z/results/caitomorph_409_predictions.csv`
(Colab, run `20260911_051357Z`). Re-scored on the Jetson with both backends:
`results/block2_v2_benchmarks/cai409_{trt,torch}/`. Cohort: stem-cell donors 99,
multiple myeloma 56, B-cell neoplasms 53, reactive changes 42, MDS 38, AML 37,
MPN 36, CMML 14, CML 8, ALL 7, 19 rarer diagnoses. Intervals: 95 % Wilson
(proportions), bootstrap (AUROC).

| Endpoint | Value |
|---|---|
| AUROC of *P*<sub>abn</sub>, AML vs donors | **0.973** (0.937 – 0.998) |
| AUROC of *P*<sub>abn</sub>, acute leukemia vs donors + reactive | 0.967 (0.935 – 0.991) |
| *P*<sub>abn</sub> ≥ τ = 0.933: AML / donors | 19/37 / 0/99 |
| Grid specificity, donors | 95/99 = 0.960 (0.901 – 0.984) |
| Grid specificity, reactive changes | 39/42 = 0.929 (0.810 – 0.975) |
| Grid sensitivity, acute leukemia (AML, ALL, AL) | 22/46 = 0.478 (0.341 – 0.619) |
| Grid sensitivity, AML | 17/37 = 0.459 (0.310 – 0.616) |
| `indeterminate` / `out_of_domain` | 182/409 = 0.445 / 46/409 = 0.112 |
| Chronic-pattern rules fired | 0/409 (declared inert on this cohort, not validated) |

Device reproduction:

| | TensorRT FP16 | PyTorch fp32 |
|---|---|---|
| Label agreement with the reference run | **409/409** | **409/409** |
| max \|Δ*P*<sub>abn</sub>\| | 0.0021 | 0.0006 |

Per-diagnosis labels: `results/derived/caitomorph_labels_by_group_frozen.csv`
and `block2_development/training_run_20260911_051357Z/results/caitomorph_409_confusion_full.csv`.
γ sensitivity (0.80 / 0.95, declared): `…/results/sensitivity_ops.csv`.

### 2.2 Golden-session parity — `models/mil/verify_report_20260912.json`

`block2_development/jetson/verify_on_jetson.py` on the device: **PASS on both
backends**. Crop tensors bit-identical; encoder cosine vs the reference ≥ 0.9999998
(PyTorch fp32) and ≥ 0.999998 (TensorRT FP16); label, tier and *P*<sub>abn</sub>
of the six golden sessions identical on both backends.

### 2.3 Out-of-domain gate on other acquisition domains

Complete deployed pipeline (block 1 + block 2). The prototype material is
non-leukemic; the gate is evaluated before the count gate.

| Session (fields / detected WBC) | Where | Label | OOD score (threshold 576.11) | *P*<sub>abn</sub> |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prototype test batch (104 / 183) | Jetson, TensorRT FP16 — `block2_v2_benchmarks/x40_stress_test/` | out_of_domain | 1024.0 | 0.966 |
| Prototype batch A (102 / 211; 200 scored) | Jetson — `x40_stress_train_part_aa/` | out_of_domain | 1150.6 | 0.972 |
| Prototype batch B (101 / 149) | Jetson — `x40_stress_train_part_ab/` | out_of_domain | 855.5 | 0.945 |
| Prototype validation batch (43 / 71) | CPU, PyTorch — `cpu_reruns_frozen/prototype_validation_batch/` | out_of_domain | 1096.9 | 0.957 |
| LeukemiaAttri AML, held-out (60 / 152) | CPU — `cpu_reruns_frozen/leukemiaattri_AML_heldout/` | out_of_domain | 1474.2 | 0.985 |
| LeukemiaAttri ALL, held-out (60 / 111) | CPU — `…/leukemiaattri_ALL_heldout/` | out_of_domain | 1602.2 | 0.990 |
| LeukemiaAttri APL, held-out (60 / 203) | CPU — `…/leukemiaattri_APL_heldout/` | out_of_domain | 1386.2 | 0.988 |
| LeukemiaAttri CML, held-out (60 / 363) | CPU — `…/leukemiaattri_CML_heldout/` | out_of_domain | 2823.5 | 0.002 |
| ALL-IDB L2 technical fixture (9 / 95) | CPU — `…/allidb_fixture/` | out_of_domain | 684.7 | 0.996 |

- 351 prototype fields were available to block 2 (train 204, validation 43,
  test 104); one training field has a broken JPEG stream and was excluded
  (350 read). Batches of 104, 102, 101 and 43 fields, limited by device memory.
- Batch A: the Jetson benchmark harness caps a session at 200 crops
  (`--crops-per-session 200`); the CPU re-run scores all 211 (OOD 1165.0).
- The Jetson record of the validation batch (`x40_stress_val/`) contains no
  session result (71 WBCs, below the 100-leukocyte screening tier in that
  harness); its row above comes from the deployed pipeline on CPU.
- The ALL-IDB fixture is the 9-field technical session of § 3; on the Jetson it
  was `out_of_domain` at every one of its 100 timing runs.
- CPU re-runs of the three Jetson batches agree with the Jetson within 1.3 %
  on the OOD score (`cpu_reruns_frozen/cpu_reruns_summary.csv`).
- Field lists: `fields.txt` in each `cpu_reruns_frozen/` directory; source
  datasets in [`DATA.md`](DATA.md).

### 2.4 Amendment 9 — post hoc, not adopted

`block2_development/results/AMENDMENT9_OUTCOME.md`,
`…/training_run_20260911_051357Z/results/amendment9_*.{json,csv}`.
Session-level blast recalibration on AML-MLL: intercept 0.133 (0.119 – 0.147),
slope 0.624, overdispersion 9.25 (controls) and 24.8 (AML). Applied once to the
409 patients: donor specificity 1.000, acute sensitivity 10/46, abstention
84.4 %. Not adopted; the primary result above is unchanged.

### 2.5 Block 2 latency on the device

Median ms, TensorRT FP16 (`block2_development/jetson/e2e/benchmark_block2_e2e.py`):

| Stage | 104-field prototype session, 183 crops, 15 runs — `block2_v2_benchmarks/timing_x40_test/` | 9-field ALL-IDB fixture, 95 crops, 100 runs — `timing_allidb/` |
|---|---|---|
| ResNet18 encoder (one pass per crop) | 158.9 | 98.9 |
| Cell head + gated-attention MIL head | 5.8 | 4.7 |
| Decision grid (all rules, three-way test) | 158.4 | 76.1 |
| **Block 2 total** | **323.5** | **180.6** |

### 2.6 Real 104-field prototype session, end to end — `block2_v2_benchmarks/timing_x40_test/`, `energy_x40_test/`

Native 4032 × 3040 fields; block 1 on the PyTorch path in this campaign.

| Stage | Median (15 runs) |
|---|---|
| Localization | 17.75 s |
| Crop extraction | 10.81 s |
| Block 2 | 0.32 s |
| Persistence | 9.69 s |
| **Total** | **39.2 s** (≈ 0.38 s per field) |

Energy (300 s window): mean board power 6.90 W, net energy 65.3 J per session,
peak RAM 6.38 GB, maximum GPU / CPU temperature 54.1 / 54.0 °C.

---

## 3. Nine-field technical session on the device

Fixture: `benchmark_session.txt` (9 ALL-IDB L2 fields, 95 detected WBCs), a
technical fixture, not a clinical session. Block 2 returns `out_of_domain` on it
at every run; the whole block-2 pass is still executed and timed.

### 3.1 Deployed pipeline — `results/block2_v2_benchmarks/deployed_latency/`, `deployed_energy/`

Median of 100 runs, block 1 on the PyTorch path in this campaign (no YOLO
engine), block 2 TensorRT FP16:

| Stage | ms |
|---|---|
| Localization (9 fields) | 775.0 |
| Crop extraction | 333.0 |
| Crop → tensor | 224.4 |
| Block 2: encoder / heads / grid | 105.7 / 4.9 / 77.4 |
| Output persistence | 356.2 |
| **Total** | **1892.0** (P95 1971.7) |

Power, 300 s per mode, VDD_IN rail:

| Mode | Mean power |
|---|---|
| Idle | 5.23 W |
| Camera acquisition (1280 × 720 at 30 fps) | 5.68 W |
| Analysis loop | 7.70 W (+2.48 W over idle) |
| Net energy per analysis | 4.61 J |
| Peak RAM · max GPU / CPU temperature | 2.97 GB · 54.9 / 55.2 °C |

### 2.4a Progressive OOD perturbation control — `experiments/ood_progressive_degradation/`

The frozen encoder, OOD statistics and threshold were evaluated on fixed
200-crop bags from 20 cAItomorph stem-cell donors and 10 AML patients. Six
levels each of Gaussian blur and combined desaturation/hue shift were applied
without refitting. Under maximal blur, rejection increased from 1/20 to 20/20
for donors and from 2/10 to 10/10 for AML. Under maximal color perturbation it
increased to 9/20 and 5/10. Median within-patient Spearman correlations with
perturbation severity were 1.000 for donors and 0.943/0.971 for AML under blur
and color, respectively. Individual trajectories were not uniformly monotonic.
This control demonstrates sensitivity to controlled image shifts; it does not
identify a specific camera or microscope.

## 4. Limitations and open items

- The adaptation set comes from one non-leukemic educational smear. Frozen
  evaluation on two additional smears provides preliminary inter-slide evidence,
  but does not establish robustness across laboratories, staining protocols,
  devices, operators or clinical populations.
- The operating point (conf 0.18) was selected on the prototype validation
  split, not on an independent source-domain split.
- In the campaigns of § 2.6 and § 3.1 block 1 ran on the PyTorch path; the
  TensorRT localizer numbers of § 1.6 are isolated measurements.
- Chronic-pattern rules never fired on the 409 patients: inert on this cohort,
  not validated.
- µm-per-pixel calibration of the optical path (stage micrometer) is not yet
  measured.
